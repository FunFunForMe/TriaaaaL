```
**Your Token is your LINE Primary token, you can get it from Sniffing your LINE account or generate from your Auth Key*

You can get Primary token form Sniffing or generate it by using Authkey or Generete token Bot.
If you want run AJS (Anti-js) or Pending bots for backup your Assist. You need to input Other token (Diffrent Another Token) into Value of key "Authoken"
```JSON
{
  "Authoken":"*INPUT_YOUR_TOKEN"
}
```

Please note, **you must input Token into value of Authoken** for run this bot. but you are **free to input Token into value of Authoken**.

if You if you don't put the token in the value of ajsToken, then your bot will run as Single Assist.
